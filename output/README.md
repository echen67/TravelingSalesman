# TravelingSalesman
All of our code is contained in one file. There are four different functions, one for each algorithm. There are also helper functions for some of the algorithms. A different algorithm is called based on what arguments we get for the -alg parameter. Each function outputs the best tour, best quality, and trace values. These items are written into a file at the end of the main function.
